function truth = get_truth(array_name, position_array, position_source, required_time, is_dev)

% truth = get_truth(array_name, position_array, position_source, required_time, is_dev)     
% creates structure containing OptiTrac ground truth data for and relative to the specified array
%
% Inputs:
%   array_name:       String containing array name: 'eigenmike', 'dicit', 'benchmark2', 'dummy'
%   position_array:   Structure containing array position data
%   position_source:  Structure containing source position data
%   required_time:    Vector of timestamps at which ground truth is required
%   is_dev:           If 0, the evaluation database is considered and the 
%                     development database otherwise.
%
% Outputs:
%   truth:            Structure containing ground truth data
%                     Positional information about the sound sources are
%                     only returned for the development datbase 
%                     (is_dev = 1).
